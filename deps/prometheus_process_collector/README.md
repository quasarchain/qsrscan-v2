Collector which exports the current state of process metrics including cpu, memory, file descriptor usage and native threads count as well as the process start and up times.

- FreeBSD;
- Linux - uses /proc;
- MacOS X (expiremental).

## Installation

**Hex package note**: Because OTP strictly validates NIF version c_src was compiled with, I removed precompiled binaries from the Hex package. This means that OTP source code is needed to build this library.

Also collector needs to be registered (for example in default registry):

```erlang
prometheus_registry:register_collector(prometheus_process_collector)
```

```elixir
require Prometheus.Registry
Prometheus.Registry.register_collector(:prometheus_process_collector)
```

## Example scrape:

```

Usage
-----

You can register this collector manually using `prometheus_process_collector/0,1` or use `default_collectors` env entry for `prometheus`.

With [Prometheus Plugs](https://github.com/deadtrickster/prometheus-plugs) - just add prometheus_process_collector dependency to top-level project (i.e. [like here](https://github.com/deadtrickster/prometheus-plugs-example/edit/master/mix.exs)).
